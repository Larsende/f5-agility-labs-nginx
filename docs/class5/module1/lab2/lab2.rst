6. Notice the configuration stanzas present. We have an upstream zone with application servers defined, an HTTPS server stanza specifying the application's location, SSL certificate and key, App Protect WAF configuration and finally a HTTP server block that redirects browsers to HTTPS.

.. note:: Several lab resources also run through this NGINX Plus instance, such as ELK, Grafana, etc. We'll focus on the Arcadia Finance application for this portion of the lab.

Now that we've viewed the NGINX Plus configuration, let's continue to the next section of the lab.
