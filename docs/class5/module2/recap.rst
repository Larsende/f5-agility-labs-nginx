Module Review - Protect Arcadia with NGINX App Protect WAF
==========================================================

In this module, we have completed the following items:

- Intalled NGINX App Protect on top of an existing NGINX Plus instance running an application
- Imported the NGINX Plus with App Protect instance in NGINX Management Suite
- Simulated a SQL injection attack to prove exposure to attempts
- Applied an App Protect WAF policy onto the existing application
- Verified WAF functionality by attempting a SQL attack

We'll now switch our focus to deploying NGINX App Protect in modern application scenarios.
