Accessing the Lab
=================

In this lab, you will access all resources by connecting to a Linux jump host running XRDP.

When you first connect to the Jump Host via RDP, you will be prompted to click **OK** to connect to the remote session.

Clicking on the **Applications** drop-down in the menu bar will bring up a list of applications you will need to finish this lab.

The steps to complete each lab in this class will begin with the assumption that you are connected via RDP and able to see the **Applications** menu.

Remember these important tips:

- Lab modules are independent; feel free to tackle the modules in any order
- The username **lab** and password **Agility2023!** should work for every login
- Traffic generators and attack generators will help generate statistics, events and attacks
- All resources can be reached through the RDP Jump Host
