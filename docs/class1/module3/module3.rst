Module 3: Introduction to the NGINX Plus API
===============================================================================

The purpose of this module is to introduce the concepts of what the NGINX  REST
API can provide. The NGINX REST API can be leveraged for accessing various
status information, configuring upstream server groups on-the-fly, and managing
key-value-pairs without the need of reconfiguring NGINX.

.. note::
   Students should have a basic understanding of how to work with Postman
   and/or the CLI. Most importantly a desire to learn!
