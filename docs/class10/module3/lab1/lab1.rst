Step 5 - Publish API v1.0
#########################

Before publishing our first API, it's important to understand what the DevOps (or API Dev) team provided us.

They provided us an OpenAPI spec file (OASv3) via ``SwaggerHub``. You can consult ``version 1.0`` here: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/F5EMEASSA/API-Sentence-2022/v1

.. note:: This is version 1.0 of the API, and in this version, as you can notice, the ``Colors`` micro-service is not yet available. This means that with this spec file we will publish the API Sentence application without the ``Colors`` micro-service (e.g. a sample sentence might look like ``calm mouse of the mountain``).
