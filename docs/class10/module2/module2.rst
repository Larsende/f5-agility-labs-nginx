Module 2 - Infrastructure team - Deploy Nginx instances
#######################################################

In this class, we will deploy 2 NGINX Plus instances (API GW and Dev Portal), and we will link these instances to NMS ACM.

``Infrastructure team`` is in charge of the Nginx Plus instances. They deploy and maintain Nginx Plus instances so that ``API Team`` can deploy API on it.
